# vbstrings2go
This package contains analogs of the string functions of the VB programming language for the Go programming language.

## Why is it needed
1. some features are missing
2. index with 1
3. cleans up the mess with unicode strings
4. convenient for programmers who switched from VB

$ go get github.com/maximsitnikov/vbstrings2go
```
